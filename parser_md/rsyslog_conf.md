RsyslogConf - file ``/etc/rsyslog.conf``
========================================

The rsyslog configuration files can include statements with two different
line based formats along with snippets of 'RainerScript' that can span
multiple lines.

See http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/basic_structure.html#statement-types

Due to high parsing complexity, this parser presents a simple line-based
view of the file that meets the needs of the current rules.
